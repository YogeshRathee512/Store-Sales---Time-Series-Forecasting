## 📋 Description

This project involves analyzing retail sales data to understand the impact of holidays, oil prices, and store-specific factors on product sales. Key components include:

- 🔍 Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) using bar plots, histograms, time series plots, boxplots, and pair plots.
- 🧩 Comparative analysis of various regression models such as XGBoost, Linear Regression, Ridge, Lasso, Random Forest, and many more achieving an R² score of 0.93.
- 🚀 Created a pipeline for the model to apply preprocessing steps on input data and deploy using Flask and Render.
